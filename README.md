## Scheduled Tasks

The server runs a cron job that executes daily at 5 PM Central Time (11 PM UTC):
- Collects time tracking data from all boards
- Generates HTML reports
- Sends reports via email to configured addresses

## Data Storage

### Trello Storage
- **Time Entries**: Stored as shared card data
- **Movement Entries**: Stored as shared card data
- **Settings**: Stored as shared board data
- **Timer State**: Stored as private card data

### Server Storage
- **Board Settings**: In-memory storage (use database for production)
- **Email Configuration**: Environment variables

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Keep sensitive data in environment variables
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production
3. **Email Security**: Use app-specific passwords, not account passwords
4. **Data Privacy**: Time tracking data is stored in Trello's secure storage

## Customization
